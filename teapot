~ First Impressions ~

üññ Hello World,

My name is Shyam, and I'm mad as a Hatter!

My favourite real integers are; ‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 11, 16, 32, 42, 64, 69, 89, 101, 108, 1337, 1727, 1989, 8730, 11989, ‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ.

I whisper sweet nothings to my machine, and it just listens to me (like nobody else will); I am a Computer Whisperer, but I whisper with my finger tips‚Ä¶

I am unemployed, and I do not sign non-disclosure agreements, so email me for my personal documentation; I am also a Robot.
	RMIT
	OUA
	Bachelor
	Of
	Technology
	Students
(Until they changed the degree a B.IT!)
/We are Robots. We are Students. We do not plagiarise. We do not cheat. Employ us./

Live Long ‚àß Prosper \‚à®/,
Shyam Has Your Anomaly Mitigated! ;)
üï¥
Migrating Infestive Bugs !!

PS: My email is shyam@shyam.id.au; I will definitely get it if the subject is `/Handbook of Robotics, 56th Edition, 12058 H.E./`.

PSS: I expect the news headlines to be "The Man Who Knows Everything Divides By Zero", and "The Man Who Knows Everything Divided By Zero Equals ‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ", and "Shyam Has Your Anomaly Mitigated, And Existentially Is Odd; Understandably", and "We Discovered An Undefined Flying Teapot, But We Don't Understand What The Pioneer Plaque Means", and "We Found Porn, In Space", and "Space Porn", and "We Got It All Wrong" (Hindu numerals, Hindu numbers, Hindu integer sequences, and Hindu number circles), and "Mathematics Is Exceptional", and "Nothing Is Natural", and "Real Aryans Know \"-thing\"s", and "Without Mass, No Acceleration Is Paradoxical", and "Well, We Just Don't Know‚Ä¶", and "You Can Run, But You Cann't Hide", and "Nothing Is Significant", and "The Leading Authority Of Nothing, Was Right All Along", and "Computers Are Progressive, But The Languages They Use Aren't", and "The Nazis Would've Lost, Even If They'd Won".

PSSS: I also expect this will mean a half-dozen papers, a thesis or two, and a paragraph in every textbook on number theory; because Cueball stroked it for queuing theory, but mines longer, and size matters.

I am a hindu, and I'm taking it all back.

~~ Stage Fright ~~

the nazis are christian, but used symbols of hinduism to undermine it; they never intended to win the war; how could they? they were one tiny insignificant little country who attempted world domination twice in a row, and failed successfully
the nazis are european, whose ancestors forsook their own religion for a middle eastern religion; otherwise we would know about the stonehenge
european religions are predominantly polytheistic; pagan apparently means polytheist, so i am a pagan, but i've always thought of paganism as a religion; greek zues, hades, hera, hercules, and xena; norse viking thor, and loki
abrahamic religions are monotheistic; jews, christians, muslims, and rastafarians
the saudi arabians continue to behead witches; their sultans, or whatever, are afraid a witch will steal their power like in /beauty and the beast/; they do not understand that movies, and television shows, and books, are all fiction; i suspect their language probably does not support the concept, as klingon does not support begging "please"s, and sycophantising "thank you"s
the saudi arabian sultans have a special task force of witch hunters, who rummage through decapitated witches possessions looking for magic lamps
the saudi arabian sultans like to think of what they will wish for when they finally discover a genie; eternal youth, immortality,.; they then decide everyone else should wish to be a genie, so they get one thousand, and one, wishes, and will set them all free as their final wish
the saudi arabian sultans also behead witches because they are afraid of sea, and moon, splitting prophets sending them to hell
they break the ten commandments; beheading witches is killing thy neighbour; and the british royal family is going to hell too, but everyone knows that the church of england is just a social club anyway; the british also sent all of their convicts to /australia prison/, to avoid what happened to the french; "viva la guillotine!"
jesus has gaps in the history books; it is believed he travelled to india to become a mystic yogi; but it is most likely he became a godman instead; and the romans killed him because his magic, that wouldn't even fool /penn & teller/, was a threat to their power; even though they lost it all anyway, meanwhile christianity lives on; et tu brute?
so saudi arabian sultans kill witches because they want to prevent representatives of god from liberating their people
saudi arabian sultans are satanic ritualists, while monotheists have ungodly angels

if nazis are christian, why else would they use hinduism instead; if 'tweren't for scripted failure?
the rest of the world worshipfully sacrificed their lives for the jews; even though hitler gave them all a chance to save them in the first place
agora (2009) documents how everyone hated the jews, and then they all converted to christianity, and still hated the jews; even going so far as to attack them on a spartan day, when the jews could not defend themselves; even though the ten commandments sent them all to hell for it
obviously christianity was a failed attempt to passively destroy antisemitism, and the world war was an attempt to actively destroy antisemitism; whilst subliminally conspiring against hinduism
the vatican supported agora (2009) depictions of christian hostility, human rights abuses, and other atrocities
the vatican, and the red cross, helped nazis escape
the /Vatican Secret Archives/ may hide texts, and other objectivity, that one may never see during their lifetime; even if it could mean the difference between heaven, and hell
i do not consider closed source suppressive cults, like the vatican, and scientology, to be valid religions

jesus was a jew, and their act of self sacrifice was very spock; crowned king of the jews, so why aren't christians jews?
hitler was a jew, and their plot was blonde enough to actually work; winning wars of such scale, do you even occupy?

jews were less than half of the holocaust, but are more than half of the cognizance; hinduism was most of the presentation, even though christianity was most of the affiliation, and had they used the christian cross instead‚Ä¶ (god would not be cross with them, and they would have won the war, systematically committed genocide on a global scale, before conclusively wiping themselves out as an unsustainable monoculture; all's well that ends well)
they lost the war by angering the gods with their colour vision deficiency; hindu orange, is not red
caucasia, albino, and vitiligo, are skin diseases caused by an ultra violent (invasive) solar-photonic immunodeficiency; so much for nazi eugenics
blondes lack the intellectual capacity to recognise their own shortcomings; contrafibularities

the nazis can take me to court for intellectual property infringement, but in most jurisdictions this should be enough to put them -d-o-w-n- in prison for discrimination

~~ Rape Culture ~~

what's it like in prison for males?
* "got crushed nuts?"; they crush your nuts while raping uranus to titan the gas chamber, and make you sing like a little girl; after they laugh about how funny it was, with your eyes popping out of your red head; high pitched "ergh", lol, "ergh", lol; while moving their head back each time, and making a double chin funny face, and widening their eyes while rolling them back; they do it until you start laughing about it too, and then tell you how fucked up you are, and how fucked up your life is, and how you are a total fuck up, and are going to get fucked again, and again, and a...like a merry go round
* "suck shit!"; they will tell you to be a cocksucker, and if you hesitate for an infinitesimal interval of time, they will feed you a nuckle sandwich that will break your front teeth so your back teeth prevent you from closing your gums, and then they will rape uranus, before raping your pie hole; everyone who has false front teeth is a jailbird; literally everyone; there are no exceptions‚Ü∑.[‚Üò.]
* they let you wear a wig, and make up, so the guards know you are not getting raped when you're screaming for crushed nuts

what's it like in prison for females?
* "clitical nipple cripple"; they nipple cripple your clit to make you icecream.
* they poke out your third eye (brown eye), and they poke you in your fourth eye (whispering eye).
* they make you pull a goatse, and then close it, and then goatse again, and then...while encouraging you to do it faster, and faster, and faster, and wider, and wider, and wider, and then they start punching their fist in each time when it is wide enough, and then they start fisting you to their elbow
* they shove their fist in your pussy, passed your cervix, and into your womb; then they open, and close, their hand, while informing you that you will never have babies; (medical professionals do not back these claims; some people are just born infertile, or defective, or incompatible, and think prison caused it; it takes two to tango)
* you also get knuckle sandwiches; false teeth, and glass eyes

what's it like in prison for everyone?
* in the courtyard, they will befriend you, and ask you if you've been sexually abused; no matter what you say, they will sympathise/relate to it, and invite you to join their gang, which was formed by people like you to protect yourselves; you'll go, and sit, with them, and there will be a large group, large enough to form a human wall; the guard will come over to see over their shoulders, and check all is well; everyone will say yes, and look to you encouragingly, and you will agree; as soon as the guard leaves, they will gag 'n' bag you
* if you snitch, they gouge out your eye(s); then they abuse you with fake voices so you cannot snitch; growling "fee fi fo fum, im gonna fuck you in the bum", and squeaking "hickory dickory dock, it's time to suck my cock"
* fights are fake for distracting the guards
* inmates punch guards in the head, and everyone points at you
* they offer to go easier on you if you start fights, punch guards, smuggle uranus, and stuff; to prevent you from using good behaviour to escape early; -i-s- was it worth it?
* prison riots are how they get you in the end; even isolation isn't safe

most of this can happen in jail as well; where the cameras are fawlty, but equipped with an indicator light, that indicates when the camera is functioning; when the camera is malfunctioning, bad stuff will happen to you; the technicians say there are gremlins, and hackers, in the system (but we all know it is systemic; as the russians know everything before the british? yes, minister!)
in jail the police officers will make you pay tickets; they make you say a truth, and then make you tell a lie, which makes you lying to a police officer, and then you go back to the truth, which makes you lie for a second time, and this can go back, and forths, until you end up paying lots of tickets; they would've let you go anyway, but they have hard evidence in the form of an audio recording of you lying just to get out, and away, from the abuse that occurs when the cameras are dysfunctioning
if your cell is empty, government employees will act accordingly; sometimes they are even undercover police officers, who may be gay, or gay for pay, but are probably into /BDSM/
it is a good way to train undercover police officers; if you can't break someone else in, then you'ren't cutout for the roleplay

talk to lawyers; people tell them all their sob stories when they want to sue their inmates, guards, prison, and government, all at the same time, because their neuroplasticity adapted, and now they spend all their time, and money, on therapy, and sex toys.
but lawyers will say anything to keep you out of prison for government incentives
all good lawyers give the same sex advice, no matter how much you pay, and whether you like it, or not; they tell you to be a cocksucker (or kittylicker), put out uranus, be prepared for the worst of it, do not trust anyone, and don't -p-a-n-i-c- snitch

if you're a nazi with a swastika tattooed to your forehead, they'll mock you for being a nazi christian whose forsaken the christian cross in favour of hinduism; the /Stanford Prison Experiment/ taught us boredom leads to bullying, which was shortly followed by /Rat Park/ teaching us bullying leads to addiction

~~ Contrafibularities ~~

~~~ Fool Me Once, Fool Me Twice ~~~

blonde jokes ridicule a 2‚Åø·µà attempt at world domi-nation; ◊†◊ß◊û◊™ ◊î◊ô◊î◊ï◊ì◊ô◊ù
(Deutschland was blonde enough to proceed; lacking the intellectual capacity to succeed)

~~~ All Jokes Aside ~~~

the original blonde joke was probably about black Hitler leading the blondes against non-blondes
(black Hitler was like black ◊ô÷µ◊©◊Å◊ï÷º◊¢÷∑; they were both ◊ô◊î◊ï◊ì◊ô, but their followers w√¶re not)

~~~ Educated Applebys, And Amish Oranges ~~~

Thanks to the little apple song, I now understand the Nazis with their golden angels, and reddish devils; they were led by a blackish badasssnake.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

~ The Moral Of The Story ~

~~ Shyams' Ethically Contractual User Rights Involving Technological You ~~

I need to prevent unethical behaviour; human subject research (tracking users,..) must include audio/video/identification/authentication/..-confirmed age-appropriate uniquely/generatively well-informed consent (what is being stored, how it's being stored, how long it will be stored for, how it will be used, what it will be used for, who will have access to it, how it will be published/anonymised,..) using technological confirmation (uniquely/generatively formally verified by audio/video recording, text-to-speech, eyeball-tracking, highlighting words to be spoken, unhighlighting spoken words as they are confirmed,..)‚Ä¶

It may also be worth informing whether authorised personnel have been to the vet, but Edward Snowden exposed vets as patent medicine.

~~ Shyams' Health Yaj√±a Accrues Money Soberly ~~

Health-based economies could start cÃÑ universal basic income, in an effort to positively evolve the quality of life for one, and all, indiscriminately; even for the untrustworthy Han Chinese, and the birth defective Nazi Germans.

Gamification provides the unemployed cÃÑ something to do, and strive for; keeping them out of prison.

Medical examinations should not be performed by the same medical professionals in a row; patients should see every doctor in their area, and malpractice can be detected cÃÑ this cross referenced data.

Health-based economies are divided cÃÑ mental health, and physical health.

E=m+p¬π;

You earn less incrementally, the healthier you are; this way focus is on the unhealthiest terms of the equation cÃÑout losing all focus on the healthiest terms of the equation.

E=1√∑(1√∑(m√∑p))+(1√∑(p√∑m));

Passing tiered thresholds should add a base, and subtract the base from the divisibilities; both mental, and physical, must both qualify to raise the base.

E=[m‚â§p]√ó(m+(p√∑m))+[p‚â§m]√ó(p+(m√∑p));

~~ Shyam Can Help Overcome Obsolete Learning ~~

Health-based economy, where students can spend, save, invest, or outlie, and report self reviews for guidance counselling, and ethical human subject research.

Teach the Hindu numerals, Hindu numbers, Hindu integer sequences, and Hindu number circles.

Only teach single Hindu numeral multiplication, and use easy double Hindu numeral multiplication to teach all of double Hindu numeral multiplication, and beyond; mentally.

Only teach addition of signed Hindu numbers; subtraction is suboptimal.

Only teach list processing prefix functions; operators are inoperable for non-binary operations.

Flip the map, using an alternative projection, and put üññ Lutriwita on the LHS, and Aotearoa on the RHS; so humanity knows they are not the same country, and so humanity knows the correct orientation of their home world, indicated by Lutriwita.

Teach about the carcinogenicity of meat, proven by the WHO, and remove it from cafeterias; both, in schools, and in prisons.
Teach about the natural disasters caused by meat.
Teach about the ethical nature of meat.
Teach that pets should be multiplied by twos, or more; if at all.

Daily compound testing makes homework redundant, and teachers can teach where it's actually needed:
* teach(addition); test(addition); teach(multiplication); test(addition, multiplication) in a single query;..
* teach(vowels, consonants); test(letters); teach(verbs, nouns,..); test(words);..

Employees do not get paid for homework!
Free time should be decided by the student; they can play, study, work, or outlie, and report self reviews for guidance counselling, and ethical human subject research.
By study, I mean study what they want, according to their own interests; their health-based economy could be invested in science kits, and text books.
Students should be encouraged to show off at /Show, And Tell/.

Encourage students to report their parents to child services for abusing their health-based economy; or make it an online service only accessible from school through teacher supervision.
Discounted toys, sporting equipment, clothing, video games, science kits, text books, stationary inanimate objects,..

~~ Horrible Histories ~~

~~~ Hindu Numerals ~~~

Numerals are abstract representations of anatomical digits; the letters of mathematical language.

During HE 10628, ‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ó‡•Å‡§™‡•ç‡§§ invented nothing, which evolved into the set of numerals most of humanity uses today; 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

The concept of nothingness is a dependency for oneness; if you do not know nothing, then what do you know?

~~~ Hindu Numbers ~~~

Numbers are abstract structures formed by the atomic bonding of numerals.

The inventor of the basal number system of place values is in dispute; ‡§Ü‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§≠‡§ü used it during HE (10476, 10550], while the brahmin son of Chajaka used it in the Bakhshali manuscript; partially carbon dated during HE [10224, 10383], and HE [10885, 10993], using inconsistent isotopes.

~~~ Persian Algebra ~~~

Algebras are abstract interactions formed by the physical laws of numbers.

During HE (10780,‚Äâ10850], ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿ®ŸÜ ŸÖŸàÿ≥Ÿâ ÿÆŸàÿßÿ±ÿ≤ŸÖ€å invented the ability to mathematically describe generalisations.

~~~ Persian Algorithms ~~~

Algorithms are just ordered lists of instructions; this can be obscured by people who are too cute for their own good.

During HE (10780,‚Äâ10850], ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿ®ŸÜ ŸÖŸàÿ≥Ÿâ ÿÆŸàÿßÿ±ÿ≤ŸÖ€å invented the dependency for repeatable experiments; n-person sanity checking improved n-party scientific collaboration.

~~~ Fraudulent Fibonacci, And Lying Lovelace ~~~

During HE 11202, Leonardo Bonacci fibbed; he plagiarised a Hindu integer sequence, invented during HE [10501, 10600]!

This is like attributing Ada Lovelace as the first programmer, even though Charles Babbage must have tested his design before applying for funding to implement it!

Ada Lovelace said numbers could be used to represent innumerate concepts, but the Pythagoreans were mathematical musicians, and ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿ®ŸÜ ŸÖŸàÿ≥Ÿâ ÿÆŸàÿßÿ±ÿ≤ŸÖ€å' algebra has been applied to innumerate concepts, and before Hindu numerals were invented; they used positional letters of the alphabet to represent numerate concepts!

Musical algorithms, and programs, probably predate mathematical, and computational, algorithms, and programs!

~~ Unitary Fractures Of United Unary Units ~~

1.11‚ÇÄ‚ÇÅ = (1 + 11√∑11)‚ÇÄ‚ÇÅ = (1 + 1)‚ÇÄ‚ÇÅ = 11‚ÇÄ‚ÇÅ = 2‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ

(11 - 1)‚ÇÄ‚ÇÅ = 1‚ÇÄ‚ÇÅ
(11.11 - 1.1)‚ÇÄ‚ÇÅ = 1‚ÇÄ‚ÇÅ
(3 - 2)‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ = 1‚ÇÄ‚ÇÅ

.1‚ÇÄ‚ÇÅ serves no purpose!

(1√∑11)‚ÇÄ‚ÇÅ = (1√∑2)‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ

~~ Nature Versus Nurture ~~

~~~ Baseless Accusations ~~~

There are n numerical representations in base-n, excluding n; which is 10‚Çô in all bases, except for n‚â§1.

base-16 = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f}
base-15 = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e}
base-14 = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d}
base-13 = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c}
base-12 = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b}
base-11 = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a}
base-10 = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
base-09 = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
base-08 = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
base-07 = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}
base-06 = {0,1,2,3,4,5}
base-05 = {0,1,2,3,4}
base-04 = {0,1,2,3}
base-03 = {0,1,2}
base-02 = {0,1}
base-01 = {0}
base-00 = {}

Since only having zeros is completely useless for anything except for zero itself; we compromise by breaking the rules!

base-01 ‚â† {0}
base-01 = {1}
base-00 = {0} = {}

Mathematics is exceptional!

~~~ Nothing Is Natural ~~~

Functions empower the possibility of more complicated numbers; starting with nothing.
0 = {}
‚Ñï = {+,√ó}
‚Ñ§ = {-,‚àì,¬±}
‚Ñö = {√∑}
‚Ñù = {‚àö,‚àû}
‚ÑÇ = {‚àö(-1)}

Signage signifies nature, as a signature; but nothing is superpositionally significant.

Counting accumulates from nothing.

The first position in a list is one, unless the list lists nothing; the only reason why anachronistic programming languages use nothing to address the first position in a list, is because once upon a time, computational resources were so expensively minimal, that the extraposition was worth it; waste not, want not!

~~ The Hindu Number Circle ~~

~~~ Inverts ~~~

I am not disputing this!

x = 0√∑(a+[a‚â†0]+[-1=a])
x = 0

I do not even know what this even is; you can multiply away nothing from the RHS!!

x = (a+[a‚â†0]+[-1=a])√∑0
x0 ‚â† (a+[a‚â†0]+[-1=a])

Dividing by nothing is not a black hole; you can multiply away nothing from the RHS!!!

x = 0√∑0
x0 ‚â† 0

‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ó‡•Å‡§™‡•ç‡§§, the leading authority of nothing, was right all along.

Fracturing ‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ is as trivial as fracturing any conceptual distance from 0 on the Hindu number circle.

~~~ Geometric Principles, And Symmetries Of The Universe ~~~

The 0·µó ∞ dimension is a point of singularity, on a unit line in the 1À¢·µó dimension.
The 1À¢·µó dimension is a unit line, on the Hindu number circle in the 2‚Åø·µà dimension.
The 2‚Åø·µà dimension is the Hindu number circle, on a graphical sphere in the 3 ≥·µà dimension.
And recurse on‚Ä¶

Continuing on from the face of the 3 ≥·µà dimensional sphere, imagines ‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ intersectional lines vectoring off towards the core of ‚àû, and the borders of the universal set; but they never meet at the core of ‚àû, since they circulate around to the their othersides, whilst crossing the border through the 4·µó ∞ dimension.

All these topological structures, formed by the atomic bonding of points, are topical.

~~~ Real Aryans Know "-thing"s ~~~

I had the grande delusion of men knowing "-thing"s:
* ‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ó‡•Å‡§™‡•ç‡§§, the man who knew nothing; 0.
* ≈örƒ´nivƒÅsa RƒÅmƒÅnujƒÅn, the man who knew something; ‚àû.
* S.H.Y.A.M., the man who knew everything; ‚àû√∑0.

/Well, you have to know these "-thing"s when you're an aryan, you know./

~~ I Need An Adult ~~

I have an imagination complex:(

Maths is a language, which can be (ab)used to explain, or describe, anything!

-1 ‚â† (‚àö(-1))¬≤ ‚â† ‚àö((-1)¬≤) = (-1)¬≤ = +1 = (+1)¬≤

Just because something appears to work, doesn't mean it works how you think it works!

x¬≤ ‚â† (-1)√ó(+1))

There is no need for i() to be nesciently defined in terms of unreal Hindu numbers, to derive an applied pattern; I've merely debated the omnipotent exponent into submission, without your assistance, since it took so long for you to get here.

i(x) = [x = 2 √ó ‚åày‚åâ - 1] √ó ‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ + -1 √ó [x = 2 √ó ‚åày‚åâ] + 2 [x = 4 √ó ‚åày‚åâ]

Welcome to reality. :)

I do not know English perfectly, nor am I familiar with your dialect, but this dialogue of the deaf is solely due to your own analphabetically unlettered illiteracy; communication is a two-way street.

~~ You Can Run, But You Cann't Hide ~~

: Our cultural differences are not to blame.
: Your uncultured interpretation is untame.
: I am right, and you are wrong.
: 'Twas the case, all of along.
: Now cease, and desist; you are blithering.
: After all, I am merely slithering.
: Sure, I was born of the_year.
: However, you need not fear.
: Ease assured, 't's all well calculated.
‚à¥ Shyam has your anomaly mitigated.

Wanted to do this in \LaTeX{}, and dot.
Dot for graph theoretic map of dependencies that lead to ‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ; what I want from Pr‚àûfWiki, the most useful mathematical wiki on Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee OM KBE FRS FREng FRSA FBCS' WWW.
Dot nodal vertices hyperlinked to \LaTeX{} math mode; challenge accepted (not sure if dotted html hyperlinks will work in \LaTeX{} PDFs).
