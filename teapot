~ First Impressions ~

üññ Hello World,

My name is Shyam, and I'm mad as a Hatter!

I whisper sweet nothings to my machine, and it just listens to me (like nobody else will); I am a Computer Whisperer, but I whisper with my finger tips‚Ä¶

I am unemployed, and I do not sign non-disclosure agreements, so email me for my personal documentation; I am also a Robot.
	RMIT
	OUA
	Bachelor
	Of
	Technology
	Students
(Until they changed the degree a B.IT!)
/We are Robots. We are Students. We do not plagiarise. We do not cheat. Employ us./

Live Long ‚àß Prosper \‚à®/,
Shyam Has Your Anomaly Mitigated! ;)

I am a hindu, and I'm taking it all back.

~~ Stage Fright ~~

the nazis are christian, but used symbols of hinduism to undermine it; they never intended to win the war; how could they? they were one tiny insignificant little country who attempted world domination twice in a row, and failed successfully
the nazis are european, whose ancestors forsook their own religion for a middle eastern religion; otherwise we would know about the stonehenge
european religions are predominantly polytheistic; pagan apparently means polytheist, so i am a pagan, but i've always thought of paganism as a religion; greek zues, hades, hera, hercules, and xena; norse viking thor, and loki
abrahamic religions are monotheistic; jews, christians, muslims, and rastafarians
the saudi arabians continue to behead witches; their sultans, or whatever, are afraid a witch will steal their power like in /beauty and the beast/; they do not understand that movies, and television shows, and books, are all fiction; i suspect their language probably does not support the concept, as klingon does not support begging "please"s, and sycophantising "thank you"s
the saudi arabian sultans have a special task force of witch hunters, who rummage through decapitated witches possessions looking for magic lamps
the saudi arabian sultans like to think of what they will wish for when they finally discover a genie; eternal youth, immortality,.; they then decide everyone else should wish to be a genie, so they get one thousand, and one, wishes, and will set them all free as their final wish
the saudi arabian sultans also behead witches because they are afraid of sea, and moon, splitting prophets sending them to hell
they break the ten commandments; beheading witches is killing thy neighbour; and the british royal family is going to hell too, but everyone knows that the church of england is just a social club anyway; the british also sent all of their convicts to /australia prison/, to avoid what happened to the french; "viva la guillotine!"
jesus has gaps in the history books; it is believed he travelled to india to become a mystic yogi; but it is most likely he became a godman instead; and the romans killed him because his magic, that wouldn't even fool /penn & teller/, was a threat to their power; even though they lost it all anyway, meanwhile christianity lives on; et tu brute?
so saudi arabian sultans kill witches because they want to prevent representatives of god from liberating their people
saudi arabian sultans are satanic ritualists, while monotheists have ungodly angels

if nazis are christian, why else would they use hinduism instead; if 'tweren't for scripted failure?
the rest of the world worshipfully sacrificed their lives for the jews; even though hitler gave them all a chance to save them in the first place
agora (2009) documents how everyone hated the jews, and then they all converted to christianity, and still hated the jews; even going so far as to attack them on a spartan day, when the jews could not defend themselves; even though the ten commandments sent them all to hell for it
obviously christianity was a failed attempt to passively destroy antisemitism, and the world war was an attempt to actively destroy antisemitism; whilst subliminally conspiring against hinduism
the vatican supported agora (2009) depictions of christian hostility, human rights abuses, and other atrocities
the vatican, and the red cross, helped nazis escape
the /Vatican Secret Archives/ may hide texts, and other objectivity, that one may never see during their lifetime; even if it could mean the difference between heaven, and hell
i do not consider closed source suppressive cults, like the vatican, and scientology, to be valid religions

jesus was a jew, and their act of self sacrifice was very spock; crowned king of the jews, so why aren't christians jews?
hitler was a jew, and their plot was blonde enough to actually work; do you even occupy?

the nazis can take me to court for intellectual property infringement, but in most jurisdictions this should be enough to put them -d-o-w-n- in prison for discrimination

~~ Rape Culture ~~

what's it like in prison for males?
* "got crushed nuts?"; they crush your nuts while raping uranus to titan the gas chamber, and make you sing like a little girl; after they laugh about how funny it was, with your eyes popping out of your red head; high pitched "ergh", lol, "ergh", lol; while moving their head back each time, and making a double chin funny face, and widening their eyes while rolling them back; they do it until you start laughing about it too, and then tell you how fucked up you are, and how fucked up your life is, and how you are a total fuck up, and are going to get fucked again, and again, and a...like a merry go round
* "suck shit!"; they will tell you to be a cocksucker, and if you hesitate for an infinitesimal interval of time, they will feed you a nuckle sandwich that will break your front teeth so your back teeth prevent you from closing your gums, and then they will rape uranus, before raping your pie hole; everyone who has false front teeth is a jailbird; literally everyone; there are no exceptions‚Ü∑.[‚Üò.]
* they let you wear a wig, and make up, so the guards know you are not getting raped when you're screaming for crushed nuts

what's it like in prison for females?
* "clitical nipple cripple"; they nipple cripple your clit to make you icecream.
* they poke out your third eye (brown eye), and they poke you in your fourth eye (whispering eye).
* they make you pull a goatse, and then close it, and then goatse again, and then...while telling you to do it faster, and faster, and faster, and then they start punching their fist in each time when it is wide enough, and then they start fisting you to their elbow
* they shove their fist in your pussy, passed your cervix, and into your womb; then they open, and close, their hand, while informing you that you will never have babies; (medical professionals do not back these claims; some people are just born infertile, or defective, or incompatible, and think prison caused it; it takes two to tango)
* you also get knuckle sandwiches; false teeth, and glass eyes

what's it like in prison for everyone?
* in the courtyard, they will befriend you, and ask you if you've been sexually abused; no matter what you say, they will sympathise/relate to it, and invite you to join their gang, which was formed by people like you to protect yourselves; you'll go and sit with them, and there will be a large group, large enough to form a human wall; the guard will come over to see over their shoulders, and check all is well; everyone will say yes, and look to you encouragingly, and you will agree; as soon as the guard leaves, they will gag 'n' bag you
* if you snitch, they gouge out your eye(s); then they abuse you with fake voices so you cannot snitch; e.g. growling "fee fi fo fum, im gonna fuck you in the bum"
* fights are fake for distracting the guards
* inmates punch guards in the head, and everyone points at you
* they offer to go easier on you if you start fights, punch guards, and stuff; to prevent you from using good behaviour to escape early; -i-s- was it worth it?

most of this can happen in jail as well; where the cameras are fawlty, but equipped with an indicator light, that indicates when the camera is functioning; when the camera is malfunctioning, bad stuff will happen to you; the technicians say there are gremlins, and hackers, in the system (but we all know it is systemic; as the russians know everything before the british? yes, minister!)
in jail the police officers will make you pay tickets; they make you say a truth, and then make you tell a lie, which makes you lying to a police officer, and then you go back to the truth, which makes you lie for a second time, and this can go back and forths until you end up paying lots of tickets, but they would've let you go anyway; but they have hard evidence in the form of an audio recording of you lying just to get out, and away from the abuse that occurs when the cameras are dysfunctioning

talk to lawyers; people tell them all their sob stories when they want to sue their inmates, guards, prison, and government, all at the same time, because their neuroplasticity adapted, and now they spend all their time, and money, on therapy, and sex toys.
but lawyers will say anything to keep you out of prison for government incentives

if you're a nazi with a swastika tattooed to your forehead, they'll mock you for hinduism, and for being a nazi christian whose forsaken the christian cross; the /Stanford Prison Experiment/ taught us boredom leads to bullying, which was shortly followed by /Rat Park/ teaching us bullying leads to hallucinations

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

~ The Moral Of The Story ~

I need to prevent unethical behaviour; human subject research (tracking users,..) must include audio/video/identification/authentication/..-confirmed age-appropriate uniquely/generatively well-informed consent (what is being stored, how it's being stored, how long it will be stored for, how it will be used, what it will be used for, who will have access to it, how it will be published/anonymised,..) using technological confirmation (uniquely/generatively formally verified by audio/video recording, text-to-speech, eyeball-tracking, highlighting words to be spoken, unhighlighting spoken words as they are confirmed,..)‚Ä¶

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

~ The Number Circle ~

~~ Unitary Fractures Of United Unary Units ~~

0.1_10 = (1√∑10)_10
0.1_02 = (1√∑2)_10
1.1_01 = (1+1√∑1)_1 = 2_10
0.10_10 = (10√∑100)_10 = (1√∑10)_10
0.01_02 = (1√∑4)_10
0.10_02 = (2√∑4)_10 = (1√∑2)_10
1.11_01 = (1+11√∑11)_1 = (1+1)_1 = (11)_1 = 2_10

.1_1 is invalid
11_1 - 1_1 = 1_1
11.11_1 - 1.1_1 = 1_1
(3-2)_10 = 1_1

(1√∑11)_1 is half

~~ Nature Versus Nurture ~~

~~~ Baseless Accusations ~~~

there are n numerical representations in base-n, excluding n; which is 10 in all bases, except for n‚â§1

base-16 = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f}
base-15 = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e}
base-14 = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d}
base-13 = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c}
base-12 = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b}
base-11 = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a}
base-10 = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
base-09 = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
base-08 = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
base-07 = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}
base-06 = {0,1,2,3,4,5}
base-05 = {0,1,2,3,4}
base-04 = {0,1,2,3}
base-03 = {0,1,2}
base-02 = {0,1}
base-01 = {0}
base-00 = {}

since only having zeros is completely useless for anything except for zero itself; we compromise by breaking the rules!

base-01 ‚â† {0}
base-01 = {1}
base-00 = {0} = {}

mathematics is exceptional!

~~~ Nothing Is Natural ~~~

Functions empower the possibility of more complicated numbers; starting with nothing.
0 = {}
‚Ñï = {+,√ó}
‚Ñ§ = {-,‚àì,¬±}
‚Ñö = {√∑}
‚Ñù = {‚àö,‚àû}
‚ÑÇ = {‚àö(-1)}

Signage signifies nature; but nothing is superpositionally significant.

Counting accumulates from nothing.

The first position in a list is one, unless the list lists nothing; the only reason why anachronistic programming languages use nothing to address the first position in a list, is because once upon a time, computational resources were so expensively minimal, that the extraposition was worth it; waste not, want not!
