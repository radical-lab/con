My proofless computations will contribute significantly to the beginnings of cult classics, just as the masculine monad represents the origin of all "-things"; that being one, and not zero (since it did not exist in due course, at the appropriate juncture, in the fullness of time, when the moment is ripe, when the necessary procedures have been completed; nothing precipitate, of courseâ€¦).
Just as the Pythagoreans used mathematics for solely mystical reasons, devoid of practical application; I shall use functional programming for solely mystical reasons, devoid of practical application.
