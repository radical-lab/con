 * hacked imirage title page: thick ascii/unicode art animations of image/mirage like the matrix but the outline of the words will burn into their minds like an subliminal messaging system; can instantaneously stop to make the title pop, gradually fade or degrade into the cascade of the decade,..
   * MaggieCool593115 probably needs to be Maggie\nCool\n593115; otherwise each word can be mapped into a (re)curse
     * smoke machine
     * fireworks
     * Maggie May
 * live coding in emacs
   * MaggieCool593115: parsing in mercury(dcg), curry(parser combinators), elisp(s-expressions, and metamacros), perl(r-expressions, and other shortcuts), smalltalk(oops)

0. learn about law, and ethics
	* title: "business people are evil, and they control the big, bad, corporations"
	* picture: crayon drawing of me (twisty towel turban, [shirt](https://github.com/radical-lab/con/blob/master/art), stick arms reaching down to hands covering my rock, and nuts; one too many fingers), and box with a triangle on top, and maybe some (curtained) windows, and a (knobbed) door, also some green grass, and some (white cloudy) blue sky
	* theme: childrens book
	* any other title cards are fiction, or whatever
	* south park title card
	* hello little world,
	* a long time ago, in a country far, far, away; a country killed their king, and all the other royalty of all the other countries wanted to declare war on them; sadly those other royal families were not killed too, but it's never too late little world
		* the moral of the story is; vive la guillotine, vive la democracy, vive la r√©volution
	* `/historical|cultural/` laws that belong in the history books
	* microsofts' strategic war tactics against floss; don't go against the grain, instead just go cÃÑ the flow, and [embrace, extend, extinguish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents#Documents_I_and_II)
	* `/page (up|down)/` patented by criminals: microsoft, timothy sellers, heather grantham, and joshua dersch
	* samizdat; kenneth brown was hired by microsoft to underhandedly undermine floss #plausible_deniability
	* corruption; political bribes, and under the table deals outside the democratic framework
		* the moral of the story is; politicians must be held accountable, otherwise they will just `/resign|(step|stand) down/` when they stone up enough
	* isp tracking; when politicians are exempt, it raises the barrier of `/entry|competition/` #job_security #treason #occupy #sedition #guillotine #heads_on_pikes #accountability
		* once upon a time, there were some greedy politicians who abused their power‚Ä¶ (at some point attack their citizens for being too weak, and under their manipulative control; witch hunt, and long live democracy)
		* and what would a big, strong, nation do? that's right little world; they would burn them all for witchcraft, and make the world a better place
	* neutrality
	* dietaxing; tax haven sandwiches
	* eternal intellectual property; start a company, and the copy rights will last half a decade, or so, years after it "dies" (which is never)
	* hackers shouldn't be signing NDAs; data breaches happen from the [inside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_error) [out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents)
		* hackers don't need access to SFX databases; the bank that automated loans using sexist historical data
	* banks shouldn't be discriminately charging fees to poor people, and not charging fees to rich people; some banks don't charge fees to anyone
		* there are millions, or more, of dole bludgers who get paid regularly; don't fee charging banks want to `/surf|ride/` these waves?
	* slaves of shyam license; rationalisation of the main features of the license that will never change
		* requiring all code written in the language to be floss, and human subject research
			* infrastructure will automatically log usage; infrastructure requirement
			* can observe how people learn; education
			* can observe how people use; standard libraries, and maybe even syntactic features (symbolic programming, formal methods,..), also employment
			* only account id, and code, will be used for human subject research
			* registering an account is mandatory
			* education will include security; don't put side effects in source
			* `‚àöctp` (cyberterrorist training program) has some good ideas for infrastructure; social information processing
1. learn hindu numerical machine instructions (and a hex editor); the most homoiconic metaprogramming ever (syntacticless wizardry)
	* title: ["Hackwarts School of Computercraft and Electricity (for solely mystical reasons, devoid of practical application)"](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_books#Magic_and_Science)
	* quote: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."
	* picture: <s>[cyberCauldron](https://github.com/radical-lab/con/blob/master/art)</s> sonic screwdriver wand (sonically tap away your ESD)
	* theme: [the wizard book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs), [sorcerer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorcerer_(Linux_distribution)), [source mage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Mage), [harry potter](http://www.hpmor.com/), [there's lots of novels about magical programming](https://github.com/radical-lab/radical-lab.github.io),..
	* CPT120 LOC105 assignment.jy "# This is what we've all been waiting for! It throws everything from the cyberTestTubes together into a cyberBeaker (upgraded the old bubbling cyberCauldron, from the computercraft days) and makes some cybertronic observations, computer science is fun! :)"
2. learn lisp (and emacs); recursion is all you will ever `/have|need/` (good for prototyping; you can reactively [run your code, and hack it too](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_can%27t_have_your_cake_and_eat_it) (while it's running))
	* title: "have your cake, and eat it too"
	* picture: whatever my favourite (looking) cake is; a well balanced (pillars) ùÑû3 tiered wedding cake cÃÑ birthday candles ‚àµ the student is marrying emacs, and birthdays are all about "me" (or maybe a pentagram on top cÃÑ "EMACS\nMACRO\nACTED\nCREDO\nSODOM" on the sidelines for a virgin sacrifice‚Ä¶maybe a girl can jump out of it‚Ä¶maybe it can be a flip book‚Ä¶)
	* theme: food science (recipes, ingredients,..)
3. learn prolog; very different from conventional programming, and probably the most useful
	* title: <s>"Elementary, my dear Hacker."</s> "What have I got in my pocket?"
	* quote: "When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."
	* picture: bubble pipe
	* theme: detective ([‚àõ holmesian deduction](https://github.com/radical-lab/radical-lab.github.io))
	* programming language implementation should be taught from a `prolog(lisp(X),hindu_numerical_machine_instructions(Y))` POV (free `/disassembler|decompiler/`)
4. learn haskell; prolog helps with learning types, and probably the most safest (lazy evaluation makes higher order types possible (or maybe just partial application?), and the type system is an [implicit module system](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskelltil/comments/3sv090/cycling_an_enumeration/cx0msam/))
	* title: "in due course, at the appropriate juncture, in the fullness of time, when the moment is ripe, when the necessary procedures have been completed; nothing precipitate, of course‚Ä¶"
	* quote: asimovs' laws (all of them‚ÄΩ)
	* picture: whatever my favourite (looking) robot is
	* theme: [bureaucracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Minister)
5. learn shyamscript
	* title: "DON'T PANIC"
	* quote: mahamantra in devanagari
	* picture: me, twisty towel turban, [shirt](https://github.com/radical-lab/con/blob/master/art), levitating in lotus position on a cloud (in space) to hide my rock, and nuts (<s>zen stones</s> stars floating all around me)
	* theme: science fiction, space, aliens (this one will be written in shyamskrit; it will also be the only way to learn shyamskrit), tech,..
