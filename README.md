0. learn about law, and ethics
	* title: "business people are evil, and they control the big, bad, corporations"
	* picture: crayon drawing of me (twisty towel turban, [shirt](https://github.com/radical-lab/con/blob/master/art), stick arms reaching down to hands covering my rock, and nuts; one too many fingers), and box with a triangle on top, and maybe some (curtained) windows, and a (knobbed) door, also some green grass, and some (white cloudy) blue sky
	* theme: childrens book
		* good crayon fonts are expensive as stone, and some of the "free" ones are licensed ambiguously between websites
	* any other title cards are fiction, or whatever
	* south park title card
	* hello little world,
		* i'm going to narrate you many a story
		* at times, there may be moments when you will bend the knee, and beg for my pardon, but i willn't show such mercy; you are undeserving of my pardon, little world, and beggars shouldn't be given any"-thing" because they can access free food, cheaper (if not free; like me in canberra at least, at certain times) transportation (to travel all over; since free food is `/temporally|geographically/` scattered), free clothing, free shelter, free internet access at public libraries, free education (especially mathematics for budgeting, and `/statistics|probability/` for decision trees of expected values) from internet access, free lawyers, and even the dole to top it all off; but even if they don't know about all of these services paid for by the hard working tax payers, the police will pick them up, and even fill out all the paperwork for them; so little world, just call the cops on the beggars next time you see them, as any upstanding citizen would do
	* a long time ago, in a country far, far, away; a country killed their king, and all the other royalty of all the other countries wanted to declare war on them; sadly those other royal families were not killed too, but it's never too late little world
		* the moral of the story is; vive la guillotine, vive la democracy, vive la révolution
	* `/historical|cultural|religious|unenforced/` laws that belong in the history books
	* national laws should be more consistent; state laws should be abolished
	* lobotomies #western_medicine
	* drugs
		* when i was your age, little world, i used to take drugs whenever i had a headache, but they were ineffective, and i was occasionally hospitalised; then one day at school, i was taught that drugs weaken our immune system, which prevents our bodies from healing on their own; the next next time i had a headache, and my mum offered me drugs, but i refused, and endured immense pain, and agony; in the end it turns out the drugs were causing the headaches, and i haven't had any since; the reason the drugs caused my headaches was because of side effects; drugs are descriminately designed for certain people, and when the people who are descriminated against take those drugs they suffer from deliberate side effects; the moral of the story is don't do drugs little world #western_medicine #syphilis
		* sequencing indicates which part of the world you're from, and can also be used for target practice
	* hospital food that includes carcinogenic meat
		* doctor WHO conducted some research that proved meat causes cancer, but hospitals still feed cancer to patients; they used to prescribe smoking too, but that's because they were bribed by the tobacco industry #western_medicine
	* apple killed steve jobs, and blamed fruitarian diets (probably because apples are malnutritious); giving a bad name to non-meat-eating #bad_apple
	* amazons' nda doesn't protect them from defamation; yours' won't protect you either
	* oracle didn't want javascript to be a good language (lisp dialect); they are solely responsible for the worst programming languages, and timbl is bribed to support javascript #embrace_extend_extinguish
		* lisp in the browser also means emacs in the browser; C-x C-f `/cache|cookies|storage|file:\/\//`
	* oracle hired andy rubin, rich miner, nick sears, and chris white, to start a company, approach oracle for funding to use java for the window manager of android, sell to google with the oracle contract to prevent google using go (let alone c) instead of java #embrace_extend_extinguish
	* microsofts' strategic war tactics against floss; don't go against the grain, instead just go c̄ the flow, and [embrace, extend, extinguish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents#Documents_I_and_II)
	* microsoft moved their germany headquarters to munich to "influence" (bribe) their government to switch from limux to windows; die IT-evolution
		* all the universities are using outlook; rmit went from gmail to outlook, unisa has always been outlook for me, curtin has always been outlook for me as well
		* the excuses for the exclusivity of word processing files; so far that's just curtin though, and i've only done one subject
	* https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/06/27/microsoft_linux_distro_list/
		* nsa already stones with linux
	* microsoft boobs; a publicity stunt to make the world aware they contributed to linux #embrace_extend_extinguish
	* microsoft contagiously doesn't support w3c standards; timbl is bribed to let them get away with it #embrace_extend_extinguish
	* `/page (up|down)/` patented by criminals: microsoft, timothy sellers, heather grantham, and joshua dersch
	* samizdat; kenneth brown was hired by microsoft to underhandedly undermine floss #plausible_deniability
	* emacs email subsystem sold to the russians, edward snowden, donald trumps' defacebooked politics, the ones who don't get caught,.. #military_espionage #floss_demotes_spies_like_legalising_drugs_demotes_drug_dealers_and_other_illegal_activity
	* richard stallmans' printer story, my scanner story,.. #fawlty_products #consumer_affairs #floss_drivers
		* one day, there was a saint…
	* greedy icann; rich people tld
		* the moral of the story is that we can make our own dns ecosystem to name ip addresses, and make icann irrelevant #power_to_the_people
	* corruption; political bribes, and under the table deals outside the democratic framework
		* the moral of the story is; politicians must be held accountable, otherwise they will just `/resign|(step|stand) down/` when they stone up enough
	* australian robodebt, chinese social credit system
		* buggy <s>intelligence</s>
	* isp tracking; when politicians are exempt, it raises the barrier of `/entry|competition/` #job_security #treason #occupy #sedition #guillotine #heads_on_pikes #accountability
		* once upon a time, there were some greedy politicians who abused their power… (at some point attack their citizens for being too weak, and under their manipulative control; witch hunt, and long live democracy)
		* and what would a big, strong, nation do? that's right little world; they would burn them all for witchcraft, and make the world a better place
	* backdoors
	* rfid
	* truman
		* there once lived a truman
		* all of trumans' family, and friends, were planted by the government, or some other organisation; probably criminal, government contractor,..
		* when truman interacted with organisations, through websites, and other telecommunications; they were all middlemen, spoofs, fake businesses, fake governments,..
		* adware was fake, newsware was fake, television was fake, radio was fake, paper was fake; social engineering, psychological manipulation, hypnosis, brain washing, mind control,..
		* employment was fake; just work your life away
		* all of social media was fake; even if the people are real, they don't get your' messages, and you don't get theirs', because they're all fake
		* dreams were fake; rem is conveniently difficult to yoga nidra
		* everything was fake
		* even your babies are removed from your sight, at least when you sleep, and spend most of their time in (re-)education camps called "schools"; you've heard about home schooling, but never considered it for yourself, because of your fake employment, and even if you did, you must sleep, or supposedly "die" trying not to (like a kelpian)
		* even genetic testing was fake, and pretty much all technology; natural language interfaces are pretty unintelligent for a so-called artificial intelligent system that can't even learn new words, let alone new conceptual subjects
		* just like the matrix; an artificial intelligence that makes everyone a hero to fake people, because those special powers can only exists within the matrix, so the neO never ever escaped
		* the moral of the story is we are all truman (and i am literally insane for writing this since i am the truman preaching to the choir; myself, the only truman who knows every"-thing")
		* resident evil clones
	* elon musks' network makes national firewalls redundant (stone you china, russia,..), and satellite cracking easier than ever before #aliens
	* neutrality
	* human resources, academics,..
		* if it's written using a word processor, then it shouldn't be read; no effort, no attention
		* word processors are for children, and learning disabilities
	* hackers shouldn't be signing NDAs; data breaches happen from the [inside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_error) [out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents)
		* hackers don't need access to SFX databases; the bank that automated loans using sexist historical data
		* some of the hackers working at banks who have been backdooring atms to steal even more money from the banks that already pay them have been caught, but not all of them; banks should floss their sources, and put bountie$ on their criminal employees
	* banks shouldn't be discriminately charging fees to poor people, and not charging fees to rich people; some banks don't charge fees to anyone
		* there are millions, or more, of dole bludgers who get paid regularly; don't fee charging banks want to `/surf|ride/` these billion dollar, or more, waves?
		* when i make any significant income, it's not like i'm going to change banks; interest may be the safest investment, but it's also the slowest
	* dietaxing; tax haven sandwiches
	* eternal intellectual property; start a company, and the copy rights will last half a decade, or so, years after it "dies" (which is never)
	* getting the most out of your sick leave (and assignment extensions; academic integrity programs are inpirational!!! :D)
		* goto psychologist, claim depression, and get paid to play video games while you recover
			* having a `/bad|stressful/` day? boss yelled at you? don't climb out the window, jump off the building, so your family can sue them for $$$; just get paid to play video games instead
		* goto doctor, claim back pain, and get a free full body massage
			* no ergonomic chairs? no adjustable tables? no gym membership? don't claim compensation; just get a free full body massage instead, or maybe try acupuncture,..
		* goto doctor, claim gastro (it means `/vomiting|diarrhoea/`), and get paid to convincingly eat beans
		* goto med student friend, ask for forged doctors note, and this could probably work work too
			* there's actually a med student in my dorm; i should ask for more of these
	* slaves of shyam license; rationalisation of the main features of the license that will never change
		* requiring all code written in the language to be floss, and human subject research
			* infrastructure will automatically log usage; infrastructure requirement
			* can observe how people learn; education
			* can observe how people use; standard libraries, and maybe even syntactic features (symbolic programming, formal methods,..), also employment
			* only account id, and code, will be used for human subject research
			* registering an account is mandatory
			* education will include security; don't put side effects in source
			* `√ctp` (cyberterrorist training program) has some good ideas for infrastructure; social information processing
			* floss drivers; [ (卐) ]
1. learn hindu numerical machine instructions (and a hex editor); the most homoiconic metaprogramming ever (syntacticless wizardry)
	* title: ["Hackwarts School of Computercraft and Electricity (for solely mystical reasons, devoid of practical application)"](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_books#Magic_and_Science)
	* quote: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."
	* picture: <s>[cyberCauldron](https://github.com/radical-lab/con/blob/master/art)</s> sonic screwdriver wand (sonically tap away your ESD)
	* theme: [the wizard book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs), [sorcerer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorcerer_(Linux_distribution)), [source mage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Mage), [harry potter](http://www.hpmor.com/), [there's lots of novels about magical programming](https://github.com/radical-lab/radical-lab.github.io),..
	* CPT120 LOC105 assignment.jy "# This is what we've all been waiting for! It throws everything from the cyberTestTubes together into a cyberBeaker (upgraded the old bubbling cyberCauldron, from the computercraft days) and makes some cybertronic observations, computer science is fun! :)"
2. learn lisp (and emacs); recursion is all you will ever `/have|need/` (good for prototyping; you can reactively [run your code, and hack it too](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_can%27t_have_your_cake_and_eat_it) (while it's running))
	* title: "have your cake, and eat it too"
	* picture: whatever my favourite (looking) cake is; a well balanced (pillars) 𝄞3 tiered wedding cake c̄ birthday candles ∵ the student is marrying emacs, and birthdays are all about "me" (or maybe a pentagram on top c̄ "EMACS\nMACRO\nACTED\nCREDO\nSODOM" on the sidelines for a virgin sacrifice…maybe a girl can jump out of it…maybe it can be a flip book…)
	* theme: food science (recipes, ingredients,..)
3. learn prolog; very different from conventional programming, and probably the most useful
	* title: <s>"Elementary, my dear Hacker."</s> "What have I got in my pocket?"
	* quote: "When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."
	* picture: bubble pipe
	* theme: detective ([∛ holmesian deduction](https://github.com/radical-lab/radical-lab.github.io))
	* backtracking into infinite is an extra (debugging) step up from recursing into infinite from lisp; in prolog you get both, yay what fun
	* programming language implementation should be taught from a `prolog(lisp(X),hindu_numerical_machine_instructions(Y))` POV (free `/disassembler|decompiler/`)
	* deductive knowledgebases supercede most databases; the only kind that should be taught these days
4. learn haskell; prolog helps with learning types, and probably the most safest (lazy evaluation makes higher order types possible (or maybe just partial application?), and the type system is an [implicit module system](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskelltil/comments/3sv090/cycling_an_enumeration/cx0msam/))
	* title: "in due course, at the appropriate juncture, in the fullness of time, when the moment is ripe, when the necessary procedures have been completed; nothing precipitate, of course…"
	* quote: asimovs' laws (all of them‽)
	* picture: whatever my favourite (looking) robot is
	* theme: [bureaucracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Minister)
5. learn shyamscript
	* title: "DON'T PANIC"
	* quote: mahamantra in devanagari
	* picture: me, twisty towel turban, [shirt](https://github.com/radical-lab/con/blob/master/art), levitating in lotus position on a cloud (in space) to hide my rock, and nuts (<s>zen stones</s> stars floating all around me)
	* theme: science fiction, space, aliens (this one will be written in shyamskrit; it will also be the only way to learn shyamskrit), tech,..
