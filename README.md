i also want to do workshops
<br>i also want to make educational games, or gamified education
<br>i also want to write a book (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Search_problem#Undone_deletion)

1. learn hindu numerical machine instructions (and a hex editor); the most homoiconic metaprogramming ever (syntacticless wizardry)
	* title: ["Hackwarts School of Computercraft and Electricity (for solely mystical reasons, devoid of practical application)"](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_books#Magic_and_Science)
	* quote: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."
	* picture: <s>[cyberCauldron](https://github.com/radical-lab/con/blob/master/art)</s> sonic screwdriver wand (sonically tap away your ESD)
	* theme: [the wizard book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs), [sorcerer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorcerer_(Linux_distribution)), [source mage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Mage), [harry potter](http://www.hpmor.com/), [there's lots of novels about magical programming](https://github.com/radical-lab/radical-lab.github.io),..
	* CPT120 LOC105 assignment.jy "# This is what we've all been waiting for! It throws everything from the cyberTestTubes together into a cyberBeaker (upgraded the old bubbling cyberCauldron, from the computercraft days) and makes some cybertronic observations, computer science is fun! :)"
2. learn lisp (and emacs); recursion is all you will ever `/have|need/` (good for prototyping; you can reactively [run your code, and hack it too](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_can%27t_have_your_cake_and_eat_it) (while it's running))
	* title: "have your cake, and eat it too"
	* picture: whatever my favourite (looking) cake is; a well balanced (pillars) 𝄞3 tiered wedding cake c̄ birthday candles ∵ the student is marrying emacs, and birthdays are all about "me" (or maybe a pentagram on top c̄ "EMACS\nMACRO\nACTED\nCREDO\nSODOM" on the sidelines for a virgin sacrifice…maybe a girl can jump out of it…maybe it can be a flip book…)
	* theme: food science (recipes, ingredients,..)
3. learn prolog; very different from conventional programming, and probably the most useful
	* title: <s>"Elementary, my dear Hacker."</s> "What have I got in my pocket?"
	* quote: "When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."
	* picture: bubble pipe
	* theme: detective ([∛ holmesian deduction](https://github.com/radical-lab/radical-lab.github.io))
	* programming language implementation should be taught from a `prolog(lisp(X),Y)` POV
4. learn haskell; prolog helps with learning types, and probably the most safest (lazy evaluation makes higher order types possible (or maybe just partial application?), and the type system is an [implicit module system](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskelltil/comments/3sv090/cycling_an_enumeration/cx0msam/))
	* title: "in due course, at the appropriate juncture, in the fullness of time, when the moment is ripe, when the necessary procedures have been completed; nothing precipitate, of course…"
	* quote: asimovs' laws (all of them‽)
	* picture: whatever my favourite (looking) robot is
	* theme: [bureaucracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Minister)
5. learn shyamscript
	* title: "DON'T PANIC"
	* quote: mahamantra in devanagari
	* picture: me, twisty towel turban, [shirt](https://github.com/radical-lab/con/blob/master/art), levitating in lotus position on a cloud (in space) to hide my rock, and nuts (<s>zen stones</s> stars floating all around me)
	* theme: science fiction, space, aliens (this one will be written in shyamskrit; it will also be the only way to learn shyamskrit), tech,..
