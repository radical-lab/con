i also want to do workshops
<br>i also want to make educational games, or gamified education

programming language implementation should be taught from a `prolog(lisp(X),Y)` pov

learn numerical machine instructions first; the most homoiconic metaprogramming ever (syntacticless wizardry)
<br>learn lisp (and emacs) second; recursion is all you will ever `/have|need/`
<br>learn prolog third; different from conventional programming 
<br>learn haskell fourth; prolog helps with learning types
