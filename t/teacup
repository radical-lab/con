jews were less than half of the holocaust, but are more than half of the cognizance

the holocaust was just misdirection; only the jews are ever considered
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism#Racial_theories
After the war began, the race defilement law was extended to include all foreigners (non-Germans).[137]
At the bottom of the racial scale of non-Aryans were Jews, Romanis, Slavs[138] and blacks.[139]
To maintain the "purity and strength" of the Aryan race, the Nazis eventually sought to exterminate Jews, Romani, Slavs and the physically and mentally disabled.[138][140]
Other groups deemed "degenerate" and "asocial" who were not targeted for extermination, but were subjected to exclusionary treatment by the Nazi state, included homosexuals, blacks, Jehovah's Witnesses and political opponents.[140]
One of Hitler's ambitions at the start of the war was to exterminate, expel or enslave most or all Slavs from Central and Eastern Europe in order to acquire living space for German settlers.[141]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary,_mother_of_Jesus
Born	September 8 (traditional; Nativity of Mary) c. 18 BC[1]
Some apocryphal accounts state that at the time of her betrothal to Joseph, Mary was 12–14 years old, and he was ninety years old, but such accounts are unreliable.[62]
According to ancient Jewish custom, Mary could have been betrothed at about 12.[63]
Hyppolitus of Thebes claims that Mary lived for 11 years after the death of her son Jesus, dying in 41 AD.[64]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_the_Roman_Empire
The history of the Jews in the Roman Empire traces the interaction of Jews and Romans during the period of the Roman Empire (27 BC – AD 476).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus
Born	c. 4 BC[a] Judea, Roman Empire[5]

anzac day to me is just about conscripts playing soccer before hopelessly jumping out of the trenches, and running into bullets like cannon fodder; all because of lag
it was like an ineffective tokubetsu kōgekitai, even though the sitch was not a kobayashi maru
basically we celebrate how incompetent our government is; including celebrating the kelly gang of cop killers
