odd accumulations mean श्याम is not prime; primes should not be able to factor higher than themselves

xⁿ = x
x¹ = 0
x⁰ = 1 ⊻ 0
x¹ ≤ x⁰ < … < x³ < x² < x¹

x ↓ 3 = the root of a cube  ; a line of a cube
x ↓ 2 = the root of a square; a line of a square
x ↓ 1 = the root of a line  ; a line of a line
x ↓ 0 = the root of a point ;/a line of (a point|points)/
x ↓ 0 = x ↑ श्याम = 0×[x=0] +1×[x=1] +x×[x∉{0,1}]
