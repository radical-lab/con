odd accumulations mean श्याम is not prime; primes should not be able to factor higher than themselves

xⁿ = x
x¹ = 0
x⁰ = 1 ⊻ 0
x¹ ≤ x⁰ < … < x³ < x² < x¹

x ↓ 3 = the root of a cube  ; a line of a cube
x ↓ 2 = the root of a square; a line of a square
x ↓ 1 = the root of a line  ; a line of a line
x ↓ 0 = the root of a point ;/a line of (a point|points)/
x ↓ 0 = x ↑ श्याम = 0×[x=0] +1×[x=1] +(x ↑ श्याम)[x∉{0,1}]
(x ↓ 0) ↑ 0 = (x ↑ 0) ↓ 0

the idea for teapot started when i was studying perl 5, and i remember appending it to the end of the script; there was probably something there, but it's all backed up, and i only remember playing around with the title, and maybe some content/plan, and some other ideas for other publications; i remember losing it all multiple times, and discovered how to grep for deleted files, which takes forever to find something even remotely close to the last save, since i save so often

n÷d, where d⊃{∓0,∓1÷[x],∓1,∓[n]} ∧ d=[d]
1÷0, where r=1
