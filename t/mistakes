odd accumulations mean श्याम is not prime; primes should not be able to factor higher than themselves, nor should geometry be rooted above its' self

xⁿ = x
x¹ = 0
x⁰ = 1 ⊻ 0
x¹ ≤ x⁰ < … < x³ < x² < x¹

x ↓ 3 = the root of a cube  ; a line of a cube
x ↓ 2 = the root of a square; a line of a square
x ↓ 1 = the root of a line  ; a line of a line
x ↓ 0 = the root of a point ;/a line of (a point|points)/
x ↓ 0 = x ↑ श्याम = 0×[x=0] +1×[x=1] +(x ↑ श्याम)[x∉{0,1}]
(x ↓ 0) ↑ 0 = (x ↑ 0) ↓ 0
x ↓ (0÷0) = x ↑ (0÷0) = x ↓ (1÷0) = x ↑ (0÷1) ≠ x ↓ (0÷1) = x ↑ (1÷0)

the idea for teapot started when i was studying perl 5, and i remember appending it to the end of the script; there was probably something there, but it's all backed up, and i only remember playing around with the title, and maybe some content/plan, and some other ideas for other publications; i remember losing it all multiple times, and discovered how to grep for deleted files, which takes forever to find something even remotely close to the last save, since i save so often
i should look this up; what are the other publications?

∀x: x⁰ = x÷x
∨
∀x: x⁰ = 1

∀ x: P(x) means P(x) is true "for all" x.
A x: P(x) means P(x) is true "for atleast a" x.
A!x: P(x) means P(x) is true "for a" x.
A¬x: P(x) means P(x) is true "for <1" x.
E x: P(x) means P(x) is true "for each, and every" x.
∃ x: P(x), means P(x) is true "for ≥1" x.
∃!x: P(x), means P(x) is true "for =1" x.
∃¬x: P(x), means P(x) is true "for <1" x.

decimals c̄out decimals
.x=1÷(bˣ)
.x=1÷(xᵇ)
there's some way of doing this to say that .1=(1÷(1¹))=1, and i'm sure it has some"-thing" to do c̄ the base

E=mp¹
x÷y = (m÷p)[p≤m]+(p÷m)[m≤p]
y÷x = (m÷p)[m≤p]+(p÷m)[p≤m]
