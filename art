probably can't afford shirts/e*t*c*; just use stickers
(i also want fireworks on either side of the slides, and maybe a smoke machine,..)

from line 105 of my 1ˢᵗ assignment in Jython (CPT120)
    # This is what we've all been waiting for! It throws everything from the cyberTestTubes together into a cyberBeaker (upgraded the old bubbling cyberCauldron, from the computercraft days) and makes some cybertronic observations, computer science is fun! :)

i*d*k* how to draw what i have in mind…

curvies for the sides of the cauldron
λ on the front of the cauldron
pulp fiction halo on top of the cauldron
bubbles on top of the halo
maths symbols on the bubbles
some separate bubble stickers
separate test tube sticker c̄ an → for typical type theory
separate beaker sticker c̄ an ∘ for compositional category theory

the bubbles could have 27 letters instead, one for each letter of the english alphabet; abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxynz
